    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>
        Jollof rice is a popular West African dish known for its rich, 
        smoky flavor and vibrant red color. It is made by cooking rice 
        in a flavorful tomato-based sauce, seasoned with onions, garlic,
         ginger, and a blend of spices such as thyme, bay leaves, and 
         curry powder. The dish typically includes bell peppers and 
         scotch bonnet peppers for heat, giving it a spicy kick. While 
         variations exist across different countries, the Nigerian 
         version is often cooked with long-grain parboiled rice and 
         sometimes includes proteins like chicken, beef, or shrimp. 
         The key to a perfect Jollof rice is allowing the rice to 
         absorb the sauce fully, giving it a distinct depth of flavor.
          It is commonly served with fried plantains, salad, or grilled
           meat, making it a staple at gatherings and celebrations.</p1>

        <li>Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, and scotch bonnet pepper into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat and sauté the chopped onions until soft.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, stirring for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a few minutes to remove its raw taste.</li>

        <li>Check occasionally and stir gently to prevent burning, adding a little water or broth if needed.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed all the flavors, fluff it with a fork.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sliced onions and bell peppers for extra flavor and presentation.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with fried plantains, grilled chicken, or salad.</li>
