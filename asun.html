    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>
        Asun is a spicy Nigerian dish made from grilled goat meat 
        tossed in a fiery pepper sauce. Originally from the 
        Yoruba-speaking regions, this dish is known for its smoky and 
        intensely spicy flavor. The goat meat is first grilled until 
        tender, then stir-fried with onions, scotch bonnet peppers, 
        and other seasonings. It is a popular delicacy at parties and 
        gatherings, often served as an appetizer or side dish.
