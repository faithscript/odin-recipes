    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>
        Ofada Stew, also known as Ayamase, is a rich and spicy Nigerian
         stew made from green bell peppers, onions, and a blend of 
         indigenous spices. This stew is commonly served with Ofada 
         rice, a locally grown variety with a unique aroma. 
         Traditionally prepared with bleached palm oil, it 
         features assorted meats such as beef, tripe, and offals, 
         giving it a deep, smoky taste. The secret to its rich flavor 
         lies in slow cooking, allowing the flavors to meld together 
         beautifully.
